You may want to start by making some audio files available on your device. There is a link at the top of the menu page to various test audio, or you can go here: https://tinyurl.com/Wyrdaudio 
If you are using the web apps in Chrome and are signed in, you will be able to load audio from your Google Drive.

The apps should work on all browser equipped devices, some of the interfaces need some work for use on mobile as they overlap too much.

Please send or link me to anything you create with them!
